### Release Notes

See [ReleaseNotes](ReleaseNotes.md) for all information regarding the (newest) releases.

## Getting Started

### Developing the library

The library can be built for development using the following command:

```sh
npm run watch
```

This will build the library and watch for changes. The library can be used in the demo application that ships with this repository.
There is no need to link the library to the demo application by hand, as the demo application already knows the paths to the dist folder of the library, thanks to `tsconfig.json`.
Once the library is built, the demo application can be started using the following command:

```sh
npm run start
```

To avoid having to start and manage two terminal windows for the commands above, you can simply run the following command to start the watch and serve processes in one terminal window:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the library in watch mode and the demo application in serve mode. The demo application will automatically reload when changes are made to the library.

For further information on how to use the library in the demo application, please refer to the [demo application README](./demo/README.md).

### How to build

The library can be built using the following commands, if they are installed natively:

```sh
npm clean-install
npm run build
```

### Tests

From the IDE, if you are using JetBrains ones, you can run the tests by downloading the [Karma Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7287-karma).

You can run all unit tests once with the following command:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Usage

To use this library in your project, install it via npm, if you have access to a registry, where this library is pushed to:

```bash
npm install @gematik/demis-portal-core-library
```

If you do not have access to a registry that has this library available, you first need to build it yourself (see: <a href="#builddev">build:dev</a>).
Afterwards, you can deploy this local build to any desired Angular project by utilizing the convenience script <a href="#deploy-local-dev-package">deploy-local-dev-package</a>.

**BEWARE!** This will most likely always affect the dependency tree of the target Angular project!

### Creating a new component

To create a new component in the library, you can use the Angular CLI command:

```bash
ng g c components/component-name --project @gematik/demis-portal-core-library
```

## Development Scripts

There are several scripts available for local development that simplify the workflow between local TGZ builds and registry installations:

### build:dev

Builds the library and packs it into a TGZ file in the `dist/` directory.
This is useful for local development and testing before deploying to a registry.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Build the library and create a TGZ file in dist/
npm run build:dev
```

### deploy-local-dev-package

Installs the locally built TGZ version of the Portal-Core-Library into a target project.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Installs the latest TGZ file from dist/
npm run deploy-local-dev-package ../portal-shell

# Or directly:
node .local-scripts/deploy-local-dev-package.js ../portal-shell
```

**Features:**

- Automatically finds the latest TGZ file in the `dist/` directory
- Installs the local version as `file:` dependency
- Clears caches and reinstalls all dependencies
- Automatically validates target directory and library project

### restore-to-registry-package

Restores registry versions of the Portal-Core-Library and checks for available updates.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Automatic update to latest stable version
npm run restore-to-registry-package ../portal-shell

# Installation of a specific version
npm run restore-to-registry-package ../portal-shell 2.0.1

# Or directly:
node .local-scripts/restore-to-registry-package.js ../portal-shell [version]
```

As can be seen, the script can also be used to install a specific version of the library.
Typically, this is not necessary, as the latest version is always installed by default.

### Typical Development Workflow

1. **Local development**: Make changes to Portal-Core
2. **Build**: Run `npm run build`
3. **Deployment**: `npm run deploy-local-dev-package ../portal-shell` for testing
4. **Restoration**: `npm run restore-to-registry-package ../portal-shell` for production
